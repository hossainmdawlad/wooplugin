We want to sell a WooCommerce product. If someone purchases a product we will give him a certain page link in our WordPress system.

That page is a special page template will have

1.File upload(video) options(min size 20mb max 200mb),

2. A user will see all files that were uploaded (by him or by other users who had purchased the same product).

3. A user will be able to download files previously uploaded by him.

4. A user will not be able to download files uploaded by other users.

5. Admin users will be able to view and download all files.

6. If a guest will try to enter the special Page's URL he will redirect to the homepage.

7. Admin will have a setup page from where admin will enter product id and special URL.

 8. You have to use WP_REST API for uploading to the system.

9. We appreciate making that uploading a file system using VueJs.

10. Target filesystem could be AWS, Google Drive, or any other cloud storage service you are familiar with.
