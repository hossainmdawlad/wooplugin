# Wooplugin
## Project Description
We want to sell a WooCommerce product. If someone purchases a product we will give him a certain page link in our WordPress system.

That page is a special page template will have

1.File upload(video) options(min size 20mb max 200mb),

2. A user will see all files that were uploaded (by him or by other users who had purchased the same product).

3. A user will be able to download files previously uploaded by him.

4. A user will not be able to download files uploaded by other users.

5. Admin users will be able to view and download all files.

6. If a guest will try to enter the special Page's URL he will redirect to the homepage.

7. Admin will have a setup page from where admin will enter product id and special URL.

 8. You have to use WP_REST API for uploading to the system.

9. We appreciate making that uploading a file system using VueJs.

10. Target filesystem could be AWS, Google Drive, or any other cloud storage service you are familiar with. 

## Project Status within now
1. When you install and activate the plugin, you will see a menu item on admin menu named **"Woops"**.
2. In the Woops page you can choose one woocommerce product and and one targeted page.
The targeted page is upload video page. 
3. Then go to the targeted page and choose page template named **"Video Upload Template"**, and update it.
4. Now you can order products. But only if you order the chosen product, then after placing the order on the thank you page it will show targeted page to navigate. On that page you will see a file upload form.

*Didn't go for farther, as I am sick.*
*Thank you.*
